# 3DAndroidController
The use of Android Sensors to drive Android Scene, Developed on Android Studio IDE.

Creating an Android based controller for manipulating 3D content. The
specific operations to be implemented on the controller are translation and rotation. In order to
simplify things, the controller and viewer are implemented on the same device. 

The assignment requires a simple 3D scene which will be manipulated by the
controller. To create this, you will need to go to the link below and complete lessons one (Building
an OpenGL ES environment) to four (Applying Projection and Camera Views).
